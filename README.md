## Description
This project has been conducted between 01/06/2020 and 01/07/2020 as the final project of the 'Nikhef Project' course which is part of the 'Physics and Astronomy' Master's programme of the Universiteit van Amsterdam. 

The goal of the project was to create a data reconstruction package for the XENON1T experiment. The package should include tools such as the reconstruction programs and notebooks, the simulations created in Geant4 and the final report written jointly by everyone. The data reconstruction programs and notebooks can be found in the 'Data Analysis' folder in this repository, while the Geant4 simulation of the XENON1T experiment can be found in the 'Simulation' folder of this repository. The final report has been written in Overleaf and the pdf as well as the link to the Overleaf repository shall be provided.
